<p>
Strategy Design Pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
Its main goal is to decouple the behavior of an object from its state by modeling the behavior into an abstraction which could have more than one implementation.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
Then, this abstracted behavior could be used by the object with the capability of switching between the different implementations of the behavior at run time without the need to re-create the object.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
The Strategy Design Pattern is widely used nowadays. Most probably almost every solution you would come across would be using it.
